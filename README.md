# Docker Guide for AI Model Development and Deployment


This repo is divided into two parts:
1. The theoretical concept of the `Docker` and
2. [Examples](docker-examples/README.md) to get started with `Docker`.

The following is theoretical concepts of the `Docker` with hands-ons commands.

## Chapter 1: Understanding Docker Containers

### 1.1 What are Docker Containers?
Docker containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, yet they share the OS kernel of the host machine, which makes them more efficient than traditional virtual machines.

### 1.2 What is the difference between a container and VM?

Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient.

![alt text for screen readers](https://github.com/saikhu/Docker-Guide-for-AI-Model-Development-and-Deployment/blob/main/assets/container_vs_vm.png)


Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications and require fewer VMs and Operating systems.

Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries â€“ taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot.


### 1.3 Benefits of Docker Containers in AI
- **Reproducibility**: Docker ensures that AI models and applications run the same way regardless of where they are deployed.
- **Isolation**: Different AI projects can run in separate containers without interfering with each other.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale AI applications across containers.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Containers use resources more efficiently than VMs, allowing more resources to be dedicated to AI processing.
- **Portability**: AI applications in Docker containers can be easily moved between different machines and cloud environments.

### 1.3 How Docker Containers Work
- **Images and Containers**: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application. When an image is run, it becomes a container.
- **Docker Engine**: The Docker Engine is a client-server application with a server that is a type of long-running program called a daemon process, a REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon, and a command-line interface (CLI) client.


### 1.4 Docker and AI Development
- **Consistent AI Development Environments**: Ensure that all developers in a team are working in the same environment.
- **Experimentation and Testing**: Quickly spin up and tear down different environments for experimentation without affecting the host system.

### 1.5 Key Docker Concepts for AI
- **Dockerfile**: A script containing a series of instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Volumes**: Used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
- **Networking**: Connects your Docker containers to each other and to the outside world.



This is a basic outline for Chapter 1. For the complete guide, you would need to continue with detailed content for each subsequent chapter, incorporating code snippets, best practices, and real-world examples, especially those relevant to AI and machine learning.

## Chapter 2: Setting Up Docker


This chapter provides a comprehensive guide on installing Docker and introduces some basic Docker commands essential for AI and machine learning applications.

### 2.1 Installation Guide for Different Operating Systems
#### 2.1.1 Installing Docker on Linux

1. Ubuntu: Use `apt-get` to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

2. or follow the given commands for the Linux installation (same installation given in [bash file](docker_install.sh) `sudo ./docker_install.sh`) or execute the following commands one by one.

    ```bash
    # Uuninstall all conflicting packages
    for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done

    # Add Docker's official GPG key:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

    # Add the repository to Apt sources:
    echo \
    "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update

    # Install the latest version,
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

    # Verify that the Docker Engine installation
    sudo docker run hello-world
    ```
    At the end you should see the output like this:
    ```bash
    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
    1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
    2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
        (amd64)
    3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
        executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
    4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
        to your terminal.

    To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
    $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

    Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
    https://hub.docker.com/

    For more examples and ideas, visit:
    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
    ```
    
(Optional) Configure your Linux host machine to work better with Docker: [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) 

Note: Reboot the machine after installation of Docker.

Note: Always check for the latest installation instructions on the Docker website for Linux distributions.

#### 2.1.2 Installing Docker on Windows
[Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) is available for Windows 10 and later. It includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, and Docker Machine. Installation involves downloading the installer from the Docker website and following the setup wizard.

#### 2.1.3 Installing Docker on macOS
[Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) is available and similar to the Windows installation. Download the installer from Docker's website and drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder.

### 2.2 Verifying Installation
After installation, verify Docker installation:
```bash
docker --version
# If you get an error, please try: sudo docker --version
```

### 2.3 Basic Docker Commands

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```
The `-it` switch attaches an interactive terminal.


#### 2.3.3 docker `images`
List all locally stored Docker images.
```bash
docker images
```

#### 2.3.4 docker `ps`
Show running containers and the one that is already stoped. Use docker ps `-a` to show all containers.
